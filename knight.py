def across_bridge(people: list) -> int:
    """Finds the minimum time for 4 people to cross a bridge. 
    It is dark, and it is necessary to use a torch when crossing the bridge, 
    but they have only one torch between them. The bridge is narrow, and only two 
    people can be on it at any one time. The four people take the given amounts of
    time to cross the bridge; when two cross together they proceed at the speed
    of the slowest. The torch must be ferried back and forth across the bridge, 
    so that it is always carried when the bridge is crossed.

    @return the minimum amount of time possible for the 4 people to get across the bridge

#Problem 2

'''
The Knight's tour problem solved via Warnsdorff's algorithm.
Warnsdorff's algorithm: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/warnsdorffs-algorithm-knights-tour-problem/
More info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour

King's Cross Board Configuration: 

*(0,0)  (0,1)  (0,2) *(0,3)
 (1,0)  (1,1)  (1,2)  (1,3)
 (2,0)  (2,1)  (2,2)  (2,3)
*(3,0)  (3,1)  (3,2) *(3,3)

* - the value in these corner squares will remain -1 because they are
not a part of the King's Cross Board
